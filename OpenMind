OpenMind launches OM1 Beta, the first open-source OS for intelligent robots, enabling any robot to perceive, reason, and act without proprietary limitations.
Robotics is at an inflection point. Billions of dollars have gone into building machines that can walk, carry, or fly, but most robots remain trapped in narrow use cases. Software is the bottleneck. Without a universal intelligence layer, robots are difficult to program, siloed by manufacturer, and rarely live up to their potential.
At OpenMind, we believe that needs to change. Today, we’re excited to announce the beta release of the world’s first open-source operating system for intelligent robots - a universal platform that allows any robot to perceive, reason, and act in the real world.
This beta release marks the beginning of what we see as the “Android moment” for robotics: a shared foundation that accelerates development, fosters interoperability, and unlocks a new era of machine intelligence.
